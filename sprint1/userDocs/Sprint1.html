	<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		<!-- TODO: add link to the requirements -->
		In this first sprint, we will focus on the parking and pick-up logic, without considering the GUI and the trolley,
		which will be mocked.
		Below is reported the full list of requirements which will be covered:<br/>
		<ul class="requirementsList">
			<li>The system sends the client an id of the parking-slot if there are slots available, otherwise it sends 0 (<k>F2</k>)</li>
			<li>The client notifies the ParkManagerService when he leaves the car in front of the INDOOR (<k>F3</k>)</li>
			<li>The system should provide a unique identifier to the client (TOKENID), in order to retrieve the car later (<k>F5</k>)</li>
			<li>The system must understand if the client's car is not in front of the INDOOR during F3 (<k>F6</k>)</li>
			<li>The system can accept the request of a client to park in there only if there is at least one parking-slot
				available, the weigthsensor don't detect a car in front of the INDOOR, and the transport trolley is either
				at home or working (<k>F7</k>)</li>
			<li>The system must infer the correct parking-slot from the corresponding TOKENID (<k>F10</k>)</li>
			<li>The system can accept the request of a client to pick up the car only if the TOKENID is valid, the outsonar
				don't detect a car in front of the OUTDOOR, and the transport trolley is either at home or working (<k>F11</k>)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


	<h2>Sprint</h2>
	<div class="remark">

		Before starting this sprint, a brief consideration on the ParkManagerService. Until now, we have considered it as
		a single entity, which was responsible for all the logic of the ParkingArea. Based on the divide-et-impera design
		principle, we have decided to split the service into three smaller services: the ParkingService, responsible for the
		interactions with the clients, the ManagerService, responsible for the interactions with the manager, and the
		SensorService, responsible for handling the events and dispatches sent by the sensors. This breakdown of the
		ParkManagerService is not final, and can undergo future changes in the next Sprints.
		Considering the requirements listed in the sprint backlog, in this sprint we will cover only the ParkingService.

		<h3>ParkingService</h3>
		As the actors we have been using are based on the concept of <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/master/it.unibo.qakactor/userDocs/LabQakIntro2021.html">QActor</a>
		provided by the customer, we can express the ParkingService behavior as a Moore State Machine. <br/>

		From its initial state <k>idle</k>, the ParkingService can receive enterRequest, carEnter or pickupRequest,
		and it will go respectively in the states <k>handleEnterRequest</k>, <k>handleCarEnter</k> or <k>handlePickupRequest</k>.
		After serving one of these request, it will return immediately to <k>idle</k>. The detailed action that are
		executed in these states can be read from the UML diagram below.
		In practice, when modelling these state with the qak language, it was necessary to divide these states even more
		every time we needed to read a state from a sensor, but for the sake of simplicity, the following diagram kept
		these as macro states. The full model can be found <a href="../src/model.qak">here</a>.


		<br><br>

		<h3>State Representation</h3>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					The internal state of the parkingArea was represented as a map, whose keys are the id of the parkingSlot.
					Each parkingSlot (modelled as the kotlin class ParkingSlotInfo), holds as information whether it is
					reserved, whether it is occupied and the client's token in case it is occupied.<br/>

					We differentiated between the concepts of reserved and occupied because, as we clarified with the
					customer, the client can send the request to park even if it is physically distant. So, a parkingSlot
					becomes reserved after the enterRequest, while it becomes occupied only after the car is deposited
					inside the parking. In this way we can deal with clients entering the parking in a different order
					from that of their enterRequest.<br/>

					<!--To maintain persistence between different startup of the system, we decided to save the state in a
					JSON file. We opted for a simple file instead of a database because the state is small and because
					it is less resource demanding. However, we have made the design modular, so if in the future a database
					will be needed, you will only need to reimplement the interface.<br>-->

					We opted for saving the state in a map kept in memory instead of a database because the state is
					small and because it is less resource demanding. However, we have made the design modular, so if in
					the future a database will be needed, you will only need to reimplement the interface.<br>

					Those classes can be found in the <code style="font-size: 15px">kotlinCode</code> folder, under the
					<code style="font-size: 15px">eu.musarellatripi.domain</code> package.

		<h3>Interaction with Qactor</h3>

		The qak model is configured to listen for messages on port 8050. The customer already provided us with some classes
		to use for the communication with the qactor. They can be found, together with some other classes we introduce,
		reported below.

		<img src="img/InteractionUML.png" alt="Interaction with QActor in UML" style="max-width: 100%"><br>

		We defined a set of messages that the actors use to communicate.

		The <k>parkingservice</k> actor listens for the following messages:<br><br>
		<table>
			<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>MsgType</th>
				<th>MsgId</th>
				<th>MsgContent</th>
			</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<th>Request</th>
					<td>enterRequest</td>
					<td>enterRequest(_)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Reply</td>
					<td>slotNum</td>
					<td>slotNum(SLOTNUM)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Reply</td>
					<td>error</td>
					<td>error(weighttoohigh)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Reply</td>
					<td>error</td>
					<td>error(trolleystopped)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Request</th>
					<td>carEnter</td>
					<td>carEnter(SLOTNUM)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Reply</td>
					<td>token</td>
					<td>token(TOKENID)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Reply</td>
					<td>error</td>
					<td>error(valuesnotvalid)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Request</th>
					<td>pickUpRequest</td>
					<td>pickUpRequest(TOKENID)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Reply</td>
					<td>pickUpReply</td>
					<td>pickUpReply(STATUS)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Reply</td>
					<td>error</td>
					<td>error(wrongtoken)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Reply</td>
					<td>error</td>
					<td>error(outdoorbusy)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Reply</td>
					<td>error</td>
					<td>error(trolleystopped)</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<br>
		All the requests now sent to <k>parkingservice</k> by the test in the future will be sent by the webserver
		that receives the requests by the user and forwards them to the qak actor.


		<h3>WeightSensor and OutSonar</h3>

		To test all the requirements listed in this sprint backlog, it was necessary to mock those two sensors.<br>
		Since we can assume that we will use a sensor coded in qak when the physical ones will be deployed, we used
		a qak actor even for the mock.<br>

		The structure of the sensor is the same that we plan to use in the final application. We only added a dispatch
		and a state that allows to set the value of the sensor.

		Both sensors reply to the following messages. The red one is only for testing purpose and will be removed
		in the non-mock implementation.

		<table>
			<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>MsgType</th>
				<th>MsgId</th>
				<th>MsgContent</th>
			</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Request</td>
				<td>getValue</td>
				<td>getValue(_)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Reply</td>
				<td>sensorValue</td>
				<td>sensorValue(VALUE)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style="color: red">
				<td>Dispatch</td>
				<td>setValue</td>
				<td>sensorValue(VALUE)</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

	</div>


	<h2>Testing</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		Since we still did not implement the web part, our testing remained similar to what we prevented in the Test Plan
		part of <a href="../src/kotlinCode/eu/musarellatripi/test/TestPlan0.kt">sprint0</a>.<br><br>

		It was added a test to check that the mock sensors were working storing the value sent by the testing code.
		And another test (<a href="../src/kotlinCode/eu/musarellatripi/test/TestDB.kt">TestDB</a>) to check that the
		persistence has the correct number of records and that the update function works well.<br><br>
