	<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		In this second sprint, we will add the logic for both the Manager Service and Sensor Service. We will also
		implement the web server and the GUI for both the client and the manager. The transport trolley will still be mocked.
		<br>

		The following requirements will be covered:
		<ul class="requirementsList">
			<li>The client can book a parking slot through ParkServiceGUI (<k>F1</k>)</li>
			<li>When client try to do acceptIN or acceptOUT, if the transport trolley is stopped, the client should see
				an error message (<k>F8</k>)</li>
			<li>The client can pick up the car by sending the TOKENID through ParkServiceGUI (<k>F9</k>)</li>
			<li>The parking manager can see the current state of the parking area through ParkServiceStatusGUI (<k>F12</k>)</li>
			<li>The parking manager should be able to stop the transport trolley when TA > TMAX through
				ParkServiceStatusGUI (<k>F13</k>)</li>
			<li>The parking manager should be able to start the transport trolley when it is stopped through
				ParkServiceStatusGUI (<k>F14</k>)</li>
			<li>ParkManagerService should start the fan when TA > TMAX and stop it when TA <= TMAX (<k>F15</k>)</li>
			<li>ParkManagerService should notify the parking manager when the OUTDOOR is not cleaned within DTFREE
				interval of time (<k>F16</k>)</li>
		</ul>

	</div>


	<h2>Sprint</h2>
	<div class="remark">

		<h3>ParkingDevicesStatus</h3>
		The information regarding the trolley state, the fan state and the sensors state are kept inside the kotlin class
		<code style="font-size: 15px">ParkingDevicesStatus</code>. As the requirements only required us to comunicate the
		temperature value among all the sensors, in the following code we update only this value. However, should it be
		necessary to comunicate other sensor values in the future, we saved it in a map inside the
		<code style="font-size: 15px">ParkingDevicesStatus</code>. In order to send the state, it can be serialized as
		JSON. <br>
		Here is reported a UML graph of these classes.<br>

		<img src="img/ParkingDevicesStatusUML.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="ParkingDevicesStatus UML">


		<h3>ManagerService</h3>
		The ManagerService actor is the component responsible for handling the interaction with the Manager. Its behaviour
		can be described as a Moore State Machine. In the <k>idle</k> state, it will update the state resource, making it
		readable through CoAP. From the <k>idle</k> state, it can handle several request and events:
		<ul>
			<li>when it receives the reply sensorValue from the thermometer, it will go to the <k>updateSensorReading</k>
				state. Here it will update the ParkingDevicesStatus with the temperature value.</li>
			<li>when it receives the request readStatus, it will go to the <k>update</k> state. Here it will update the
				ParkingDevicesStatus with the trolley state and fan state. It will then send a requestValue to the
				thermometer. The request readStatus is sent at intervals by the web client, in order to keep the GUI
				updated.</li>
			<li>when it receives the request stopTrolley, it will go to the <k>handleStopTrolley1</k> state. If the
				temperature is over TMAX, it will stop the trolley, otherwise it will reply with an error. It will then
				go to the <k>update</k> state.</li>
			<li>when it receives the request resumeTrolley, it will go to the <k>handleResumeTrolley</k> state. Here it
				will simply forward the request to the trolley. It will then go to the <k>update</k> state.</li>
			<li>when it receives the event timeout, it will go to the <k>dtFreeTimeout</k> state. Here it will simply set
				the outdoorAlarm inside the ParkingDevicesStatus to true.</li>
			<li>when it receives the event carLeftOutdoor, it will go to the <k>resetAlarmOutdoor</k> state. Here it will
				simply set the outdoorAlarm inside the ParkingDevicesStatus to false.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		Below is reported the corresponding UML graph. The full model can be found <a href="../core/model.qak">here</a>. <br>

		<!-- SensorService, why something -->
		<h3>SensorService</h3>
		The SensorService actor is the component responsible for automating the stop and restart of the fan (<k>F15</k>).
		This task was not assigned to the ManagerService in order to increase the degree of parallelism of the system.
		It will cycle between the two state, <k>tempLow</k> and <k>tempHigh</k>, when it receives the event underTMAX and
		aboveTMAX. Within each state it simply send the dispatches to the fan. <br>
		Below is reported the corresponding UML graph. <br>

		<h3>Interactions between users and ParkManagerService</h3>

		The User Interface will be a single page application for the clients and another single page application for
		the parking manager. The application will be accessible via a normal web browser. This way users do not need to
		install a specific application to use this service and there will be less effort in maintaining one specific
		application for each Operative System. Of course, the web page will be responsive and usable both on computers
		and smartphones.<br>

		For this reason, the client side application was written using HTML5, CSS3 and javascript, using jQuery and
		bootstrap as frameworks for both the graphics elements and the interactive web page.<br>
		The server instead will be a spring web server. It was chosen in order to use the same code written in kotlin
		for the model even in the webserver.<br>

		The web server interacts with the ctxservice, the context containing the ParkingService, ManagerService, and the
		SensorService, via Coap messages. This allows to deploy the web server and the application in two different machines. This also allows
		to replace one of the component in the future (e.g. a node web server) as long as they continue to use the same
		communication protocol.<br>

		The requests are forwarded to the ParkingService if they come from a client, and to the ManagerService actor
		if they come from the parking manager.<br>

		Since it is not required that theParkServiceStatusGUI updates the status in real time, and it is not critical for
		the manager to see it in real time, we decided not to use observers. Instead, the page will automatically update
		only the status every ten seconds.<br>

		All the messages between the web server and the ParkingService actor were already defined in sprint 1.<br>
		The following CoAp messages are exchanged between the web server and the ManagerService actor:

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>MsgType</th>
				<th>MsgId</th>
				<th>MsgContent</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Request</th>
				<td>stopTrolley</td>
				<td>stopTrolley(_)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Reply</td>
				<td>ok</td>
				<td>ok(_)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Reply</td>
				<td>error</td>
				<td>error(temperatureundertmax)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Request</th>
				<td>resumeTrolley</td>
				<td>resumeTrolley(_)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Reply</td>
				<td>error</td>
				<td>error(valuesnotvalid)</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br>
		A documentation of the API endpoints created is available <a href="openapi.yaml">here</a> in yaml format
		and <a href="openapi.html">here</a> as an interactive webPage.
	</div>

	<h2>Testing</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		Some new testing classed were added: now it is necessary to test that the managerservice requests works fine,
		and that the spring application reply correctly to the requests.<br>
		The tests about managerservice are inserted in <a href="../core/test/eu/musarellatripi/test/TestPlan2.kt">TestPlan2.kt</a>.
		Every test has a comment that explain "role".<br>
		The tests about the spring reply are inserted in <a href="../web/src/test/kotlin/eu/musarellatripi/webapp/WebappApplicationTests.kt">WebappApplicationTests.kt</a>.

	</div>

	<h2>Execution</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		In order to execute the application, is now necessary, to start both the qak and web server.
		To start the qak server, it is necessary to go to the sprint2/core folder and run
		<pre>./execute.bat run</pre>
		or, on Linux
		<pre>./execute.sh run</pre>
		And for the web server, to go to the sprint2/web folder and run
		<pre>gradle bootRun</pre>
