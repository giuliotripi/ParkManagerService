	<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		For this third sprint, we will cover the following requirements:
		<ul>
			<li>The system can transport the cars from the INDOOR to the parking slots, and from the parking slots to the
				OUTDOOR by sending command to a transport trolley (<k>F4</k>)</li>
			<li>The trolley must go back to home when there are no more requests available (<k>F17</k>)</li>
			<li>The trolley should not walk over parking-slots or obstacles (<k>F18</k>)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<h2>Sprint</h2>

		<h3>Transport Trolley</h3>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					The transport trolley is the core entity of the project, as it is responsible for transporting the cars around
					the parking. It wraps the basicrobot provided by the customer, which is only capable of executing basic commands
					(e.g. move forward, turn, ...), and provides high level macro moves (e.g. moveToHome, moveToIn, ...). In order
					to do so, it utilizes the <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.planner20/userDocs/LabPlanner.html">planner provided by the customer</a>. Given the starting and ending point, this
					planner is capable to convert them in a sequence of basic moves.<br>
					It can be visualized as a multi layer system, as expressed in the image on the right. When it receives a macro
					moves, it breaks it down in multiple basic commands, and it sends them to the basic robot. The basic robot will
					then send the commands to the virtual environment or to the physical robot, depending on the configuration.

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		In the <a href="../../sprint0/userDocs/ParkManagerService.html">first document</a>, we described the trolley
		behaviour using only the three state provided by the customer: <k>idle</k>, <k>working</k>, and <k>stopped</k>.
		In this sprint we have expanded the <k>working</k>, dividing it in various substates. We also decided to change
		how it shifts between the two states <k>idle</k> and <k>working</k>: now at the end of each macro moves it goes
		back to idle. Below is reported the Finite State Machine representation, and <a href="../core/src/model.qak">here</a>
		can be found the implementation with the qactor. <br>

		<img src="img/trolleyFSM.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Transport Trolley FSM"> <br>

		At first the trolley goes to <k>idle</k>. If it receives the stop message from the manager, it goes to the
		<k>stopped</k> state. From <k>idle</k>, it can receive each macro moves and it will go to the corresponding states:
		<k>moveToIn</k>, <k>moveToSlotIn</k>, <k>moveToOut</k>, <k>moveToSlotOut</k> and <k>moveToHome</k>. In these state
		it will simply use the planner to plan the route, and then go immediately to <k>moving</k>. In the <k>moving</k>
		state, it will get the next move to do from the planner, and the go to <k>executeMove</k>. If there are no more
		moves to do, it will instead return to <k>idle</k>. In <k>executeMove</k> it will simply forward the command to
		the basicRobot, and then return to <k>moving</k>. However, it was necessary to add another state to wait for the
		response of the single step forward, because it is a request, while the turn is a simple forward. In this way, we
		can handle case of failure in the trolley.

		<h3>Trolley Failure</h3>
		When the basicRobot is not able to complete a step, it will send a stepfail message. In the virtual environment,
		it could be caused by some error in the parameters of the map, while in a real world scenario, it could be an
		impediment on the path of the trolley. In agreement with the customer, we decided to put the trolley in the
		<k>stopped</k> state in the case of failure, and notify the manager via the gui and a sound notification. The
		manager must then clear the path of the trolley, and then reposition it in the home position. This choice was made
		because after a failure in a real world scenario we could not be sure of the exact position of the robot.

		In addition to the messages listed in sprint1 between the spring webserver and the parkingservice, we added a
		new response, sent when the system can not let the car in/out due to a temporary error of the trolley.
		It is sent only in response to carEnter and pickUpRequest and is <code style="font-size: 15px">error(trolleyerror)</code>.

	<h2>Testing</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		For this sprint, it was only implemented a mocked actor, so no other tests were added. The older tests were run
		to check that the new functionalities do not break the application.
	</div>

	<h2>Execution</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		In order to execute the application, is now necessary to start both the qak and web server.
		To start the qak server, it is necessary to go to the sprint3/core folder and run
		<pre>./execute.bat run</pre>
		or, on Linux
		<pre>./execute.sh run</pre>
		And for the web server, to go to the sprint3/web folder and run
		<pre>gradle bootRun</pre>
		Since we are now talking with another entity, it is even necessary to start the basicrobot actor and the virtual
		environment, going into the root folder and executing
		<pre>docker-compose -f basicrobotVirtual.yaml up</pre>
