		<h4>Map of the parking-area</h4>
		The customer provides a
		<a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.kotlinSupports/app/src/main/kotlin/mapRoomKotlin/mapUtil.kt">library</a>
		in Kotlin to represent the map of the parking-area.<br>
		Below there is a representation of the parking area, the <k>X</k> represent the obstacles which the robot cannot
		cross.

		<h3>Additional user stories</h3>
		In order to explain better some edge cases, some examples were made with the customer, reported below.<br>
		<ks>Multiple users using the application</ks><br>
		<ol>
			<li>Client1 notify his interest in entering his auto in the parking-area.</li>
			<li>Client2 submit the request to pick up his car but receive a notice message from the
				application stating that another client is in the parking phase or car pickup phase and that his
				request is in queue. The request will be served when the previous ends.</li>
			<li>Afterwards, Client3 wants to enter his auto in the parking-area but receive a notice message from the
				application stating that another client is in the parking phase or car pickup phase and that the web page
				will reload automatically as soon as the system is available again.</li>
			<li>Client2 and Client3 remain waiting.</li>
			<li>Client1 finish his parking phase.</li>
			<li>Without further interaction by Client2, ParkManagerService fulfills his request.</li>
			<li>The application of Client3 notify him that it is now possible to try to start the parking phase.
				At this point Client3 notify his interest in entering his auto again as if it was just arrived, without
				record of his waiting. There is not a queue of parking request but just an event of finish of the previous one.</li>
		</ol>

			<li>It should be possible to swap between real sensor and simulated mock-objects with ease</li>
			<li>Data stored and exchanged must be protected</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>System architecture</h3>
		From the requirements given by the customer, we can deduce the structure of the system. It is a distributed
		system, with different devices communicating with each other in different places of the parking area. More
		specifically, we have:
		<ul>
			<li>The client devices to interact with the ParkServiceGUI;</li>
			<li>The parking manager device to interact with the ParkServiceStatusGUI;</li>
			<li>The ParkManagerService core;</li>
			<li>The transport trolley;</li>
			<li>The three sensors and the fan.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Transport Trolley</h4>
		The transport trolley is the core entity of the project, as it is responsible for transporting the cars around
		the parking. The customer has provided us the model and the code of a <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot/userDocs/basicrobot2021.html">basicrobot</a>.
		The basicrobot is able to execute basic move commands, is a CoAP-observable resource, and can interact with a
		concrete robot. It is modelled as an actor. Because we are in a distributed system, and most likely the transport
		trolley will be on a separate node, the transport trolley will be modelled as an active entity, an actor, that
		wraps the basicrobot. The following graphs show the interaction between the transport trolley and the
		ParkManagerService. These basic interactions can be deduced from the requirements. Further interaction will be
		added if needed in the problem analysis.

		<img style="max-width: 100%" src="img/trolley-interaction.png" alt="trolley interaction">

		<br>
		As mentioned in the requirements, the transport trolley can be in three different states: <k>idle</k>, <k>working</k>
		or <k>stopped</k>. The robot is <k>idle</k> if it is at home or returning home(moveToHome), after completing all
		its requests. When the robot receives a new request (moveToIn, moveToSlotIn, moveToSlotOut, moveToOut), it
		switches to the <k>working</k> state. If the robot is in the <k>working</k> state, and receives a new request
		(moveToIn, moveToSlotIn, moveToSlotOut, moveToOut), it will serve that request after finishing the current one,
		remaining in the <k>working</k> state.
		Finally, the robot enter and exit the <k>stopped</k> state when receiving the stop and resume command.

		<h4>Other devices</h4>
		We have different devices in the parking area: weight-sensor, outsonar, thermometer, fan.

		As they will all be on different nodes inside the parking area, we will also model these devices as actors.

		The customer has already provided us the code and the model of both
		<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.sonarAsResource/userDocs/LabSonarAsResource.html">sonar device</a>
		and <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.rasp2021/resources/rasp/sonar/SonarAlone.c">SonarAlone.c</a>.
		The former is modelled as an actor, which is capable of emitting event and sending dispatch, while the latter
		is a simple program that read and writes as output the distance measured by the sensor.

		For the weight-sensor, the thermometer and the fan, the customer did not provide us with any code or strict
		requirements. The weight-sensor by requirements doesn't have to communicate the weight the car, but acts only as
		a detection device. The accuracy of the thermometer is one degree.
		The interaction between these devices and the ParkManagerService will be defined in the Problem Analysis.

		<!-- Furthermore, the weight sensor, the outsonar and the thermometer must be also capable of sending events, so by
		making them as active entities, we won't have the need to interact with polling. The following graphs show the
		interaction between these devices and the ParkManagerService. -->

		For the sake of completeness, we also provided a machine-readable <a href="model-requirements.qak">model</a>,

	<h2>Problem analysis</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		<h3>Devices</h3>
		It is now important to analyze how the devices are made and how they communicate with the ParkManagerService.
		We already discussed that the devices are physically distant from each others and the Service, so they should
		communicate with message-passing. More information on the hardware of the single components are reported below:
		<ul>
			<li><ks>weight sensor & thermometer</ks>: since it is physically distant from the other components, the ParkManagerService
				should communicate with it via message-passing. It will then read the measurements from a physical or
				virtual device (mock object)</li>
			<li><ks>outsonar</ks>: Ultrasonic sensor that measures the distance of an obstacle in front of it.
				The customer provides an
				<a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.rasp2021/resources/rasp/sonar/SonarAlone.c">example implementation</a>
				of a program reading the distance from the sensor.
				The sensor is connected to the software via a cable and supports platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</li>
			<li><ks>fan</ks>: can be controlled simply giving or removing power from it. A relay could be used to switch
			it on and off from a computer</li>
			<li><ks>transport trolley</ks>: The customer provides a set of utilities to interact with the robot, both in
				<a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/tree/main/it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot">qak</a> and
				<a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/tree/main/it.unibo.kotlinSupports">kotlin</a>.<br>
				In addition, is available an
				<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/master/it.unibo.virtualRobot2020/userDocs/VirtualRobot2021.html">API documentation</a> to communicate with a virtual robot
				to simulate the moves of a real robot in a virtual environment.</li>
				The basic robot allows interacting with a virtual or some physical devices only changing a configuration file.
		</ul>

		<h4>Communication between devices</h4>
		Given the Requirements analysis it is now possible to define the interaction between all the devices in the System.<br>

		<ul>
			<li><ks>fan</ks>: accepts only start/stop commands</li>
			<li><ks>outsonar</ks>: the customer provided us, besides the SonarAlone.c program, even some applications
			that sends events for every reading or every bunch of readings. To avoid unnecessary traffic on the net it
				is better to re-implement it, to make some processing on the outsonar and only send events when a car arrives or leaves.
				To make this choice, it reads at starting the minimum distance from a configuration file.</li>
			<li><ks>weight sensor & thermometer</ks>: as for the outsonar, and to avoid a polling mechanism, those
				sensors send events only when the read value goes over or lower a specific value written in a
				configuration file in the device memory.
			</li>
		</ul>
		Since the behaviour of the three sensors is very similar, the same software will be deployed on all the
		devices to make it possible to communicate between the sensor and the Service. The sensor specific logic will
		be placed in a configuration file and the actual reading from the sensor will be done by a specific program
		called by the connector. (forse una foto vale piu' di mille parole)

		<img style="max-width: 100%" src="img/sensor-interaction.png" alt="Sensor interaction">
		<br>
		There are some possible protocols for communicating between the different devices. The most relevant are:<br>
		<ul>
			<li><ks>CoAP</ks>: (a)synchronous one-to-one communication protocol based on a request-response
				model, has even some implementations that runs over DTLS, even if it seems not popular as
				webSockets on TLS.</li>
			<li><ks>MQTT</ks>: asynchronous publish-subscribe model with a many-to-many mindset, not required
				in this scenario</li>
			<li><ks>HTTP</ks>: it is quite heavy and unidirectional, but could be used for example for the fan, that
				should only receive commands and reply with an ok/non-ok message. On the other hand, in this way, to provide a layer of encryption, the fan
			should have an HTTP server and a TLS certificate that should be renewed when expired, complicating the maintenance.</li>
			<li><ks>WebSockets</ks>: lighter than HTTP but still heavy. Bi-directional and supports encryption with
				minimum effort. Because of his bi-directionality, only the Service should act as a server and the other
				devices could easily connect to it and exchange messages, requiring only one server and one TLS certificate.</li>
		</ul>
		At the same time, it is true that only the Service has to be exposed to internet, and it could communicate with
		the devices over a private network non-accessible by other devices, thus not requiring encryption.<br>
		In this case, the Service has to be located in the neighborhood of all the sensors, while with encryption it
		could be located everywhere and provide his services with a reduced risk of in-place maintenance.<br>
		At this point, the two main alternatives are CoAP and WebSockets.
		<br><br>

		<h3>GUI interaction</h3>

		<img style="max-width: 100%" src="img/gui-interaction.png" alt="GUI interaction"><br>

		The two GUIs are represented in a different context because the ParkManagerService could expose some APIs
		completely independent of the GUIs, that can be served even by different machine or installed as mobile apps
		on users' devices.
