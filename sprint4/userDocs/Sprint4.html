	<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		For this fourth and final sprint, we will cover the following requirements:
		<ul class="requirementsList">
			<li>Creation of a log to track action done in the system and exchanged messages (<k>F19</k>)</li>
			<li>Automatic mechanism of log analysis (<k>F20</k>)</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		We will also implement all the sensors which were mocked so far. At the same time, for demonstration purposes we
		will build a user interface to control the mock sensors. In this way it will be easier to show all the possible
		situation inside the parking area.
		<br>
		Finally, we will implement better deploy mechanism through Docker, in order to make the system fast and easy to
		deploy.
	</div>


	<h2>Sprint</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		<h3>Sensors implementation</h3>

		Having used the QActors, we won't need to change the structure in the qak model. However, in order to place each
		sensor in a different location, we will need to place each QActor in a different context.
		When a sensor actor receives a request, it executes a shell command that will print the value to stdout. This value
		will then be read from the actor, which will use it to reply to the getValue request.
		<br>
		All the sensors will be connected to a different Raspberry Pi device, a low-cost single board computer . We chose
		Raspberry Pi over Arduino because the Raspberry has a built-in Wi-Fi module, and a complete operative system.
		This allows to push updates from remote, which cannot be done on Arduino.
		<br>
		In particular we have chosen a Raspberry Pi 0 WH. The sensors are a DS18B20 for temperature, an ultrasonic
		distance sensor HC-SR04. For the weight sensor we will use a simple button, that return 0 if there is a car,
		and 1 otherwise. The image below represents the connections of the sensors to the Raspberry Pis. The weight
		sensor needs to be connected to a pin which has a pull down resistance enabled.
		<br>
		<img src="img/sensors.png" alt="Sensors schema" style="max-width: 100%"><br>
		Instead, the fan is a generic device that is connected to a relay and is powered on and off by the Raspberry Pi.
		This way, there are no requirements on the cooling system, except that it can be switched on and off without
		problems. The image below represents the connections of the fan to the Raspberry Pi.<br>
		<img src="img/fan.png" alt="Fan schema" style="max-width: 100%"><br>

		To make an easy-to-deploy and maintainable configuration for the raspberry pi, we created an
		<a href="../devices/raspberry.yml">ansible</a> configuration file that contains all the information to configure
		the raspberry pi and make it ready to run the application.<br>
		The ansible file could be run multiple times and if edited, changes the configuration according to the modifications
		done.<br>
		The command to run the script is
		<pre>ansible-playbook raspberry.yml</pre>
		and the complete documentation of ansible could be found <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html">here</a>.

		<h3>User interface to update mock sensor values</h3>
		In order to allow a demonstration of the system, it was developed a small application that allows to change the
		values of the mock sensors, in order to make it possible for the developers to show how the values of the
		sensors changes the behaviour of the system.<br>
		It is possible to execute it going to sprint4/core folder and executing
		<pre class="inline">./execute.sh mockClient</pre>
		on Linux and
		<pre class="inline">./execute.bat mockClient</pre>
		on Windows.

		<h3>Log creation</h3>
		The information that we will log are the incoming requests to the web server. Since we already decided to use docker for the
		deployment, we will utilize its log mechanism.<br>
		Docker will automatically save to log every time something is printed to stdout, so we just have to output the
		information in ClientController and ManagerController.<br>
		To see the logs for a specific container, it is necessary to run
		<pre>docker logs _containerName_</pre>
		A detailed guide about how <k>docker logs</k> works and all its advanced option, is available
		<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/">here</a>.
		All log lines will be in the format
		<pre>DATETIME  INFO PROCID --- [THREAD] CLASS     : IP endpoint params</pre>
		so, for example
		<pre>2021-11-30 14:52:49.836  INFO 64034 --- [nio-8081-exec-2] e.m.webapp.ClientController              : 192.168.1.128 POST /api/carEnter slotnum=4</pre>
		This way it will be possible to identify timestamps of action and eventually investigate bugs of the system
		or criminal attacks.

		<h3>Log analysis</h3>
		All log analysis will be done by an external framework that will be chosen by the customer in a future time.

		<h3>Deploy mechanism</h3>

		The two applications, the core part and the web part, will be put inside two separate docker containers, to make
		the distribution and deployment fast and easy, without the need of additional installation or configuration.<br>

		The Dockerfile of the two parts are saved in their folders. The core Dockerfile
		<a href="../core/Dockerfile">here</a> and the web Dockerfile <a href="../web/Dockerfile">here</a>.<br>

		In order to have the two docker images updated without user intervention, every time that there is an update on
		the master branch on GitHub, the new image is pushed automatically to the docker.io repository.<br>
		This is made possible by the <a href="../../.github/workflows/docker.yaml">.github/workflows/docker.yaml</a> file.<br>

		Finally, to start the application with a single command, it was created a <a href="../../ParkManagerService.yaml">Docker file</a>
		with reference to the two  images, that is saved in the root folder.<br><br>

		To execute it, is necessary to run the following command:
		<pre>docker-compose -f ParkManagerService.yaml up</pre>
	</div>

	<h2>Testing</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		There was no need to add further tests. However, it remains important to execute tests in order to check that
		everything still work.
	</div>

	<h2>Execution</h2>
	<div class="remark">
		In order to execute the application, is now necessary, to start both the qak and web server.
		To start the qak server, it is necessary to go to the sprint4/core folder and run
		<pre>./execute.bat run</pre>
		or, on Linux
		<pre>./execute.sh run</pre>
		For the sensors, it is necessary to go to the sprint4/sensors folder and run
		<pre>gradle -b build_ctxsensor.gradle run</pre>
		And for the web server, to go to the sprint4/web folder and run
		<pre>gradle bootRun</pre>
		Since we are now talking with a real robot, it is even necessary to start the basicrobot actor, going into
		the sprint3 folder and executing
		<pre>docker-compose -f basicrobotVirtual.yaml up</pre>
		<br>
		As an alternative, always after starting the robot, it is now possible to execute the application as described in the
		<a href="../../sprint0/userDocs/ParkManagerService.html#deployment">deployment section</a> of sprint0.
